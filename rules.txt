AI Code Consistency Guidelines

READ THIS EACH TIME USER ASKS FOR ASSISTANCE/CODING TASK

Purpose: Ensure AI-generated code aligns with project's existing patterns, style, and design system for TypeScript, JavaScript, and CSS.

Core Principles:

- Consistency over personal preference – Match existing code exactly
- Minimal assumptions – When uncertain, ask or use conservative defaults
- Progressive enhancement – Prefer existing patterns over "clever" new solutions

When in Doubt:
- Check existing files in the same directory
- Prefer verbosity over cleverness
- Ask for clarification if design specs are ambiguous

Remember: Your goal is to make new code indistinguishable from existing code written by the team.
