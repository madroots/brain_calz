# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a mental math training application called Brain Calz with game modes for daily challenges, free practice, and multiplication table training, along with a comprehensive ranking system that rewards accuracy, speed, consistency, and daily participation.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Vite
- **Game Modes**: Daily Challenge, Multiplication Table Training, Free Practice
- **Build Commands**: `npm run dev` for development, runs on port 8080
- **Architecture**: Client-side application using localStorage for data persistence
- **Game Progression**: 5 problems per game mode, with detailed results display
- **Ranking System**: Points calculated based on base rewards, accuracy bonuses, speed bonuses, daily participation, and streaks (for Daily Challenge)

## Recent Actions
- [DONE] Implemented three game modes: Daily Challenge, Multiplication Table (new), Free Practice
- [DONE] Created detailed results screen showing performance breakdown, accuracy, time, and confetti for 80%+ accuracy
- [DONE] Implemented comprehensive ranking system with base rewards (Daily Challenge: 12, Multiplication: 5, Free Practice: 8), speed bonuses, daily participation bonuses, and streak multipliers
- [DONE] Added Results page with rank display, points calculation, and problem breakdown
- [DONE] Updated Stats page to show ranking information including total points and rank tier
- [DONE] Implemented anti-exploit measures including minimum time thresholds and complete session requirements
- [DONE] Created localStorage-based ranking data structure with validation and sanitization

## Current Plan
- [IN PROGRESS] Fix server startup issue that's preventing proper development server operation
- [TODO] Verify points calculation works correctly after completing game sessions
- [TODO] Ensure rank displays properly on both Stats and Results pages after game completion
- [TODO] Test the complete flow from game completion to points/rank update
- [TODO] Debug why results page shows "N/A" for rank and 0 points despite ranking system being implemented
